# Extra Shadcn
This is a project aimed at extending the Shadcn library to new types of React components. By drawing inspiration from other component libraries, it can expand to new horizons and functionalities.

## Features

- **Color Palette**: All components in this library are compatible with your color settings, so they will adjust accordingly.
- **Ready Components**: At the moment, it does not have its own CLI, so these components were designed to be copied and imported into your project (Tailwind and Shadcn are required).

## Typography

Although it uses Shadcn's default typography, some internal components may use Geist or GeistMono for a certain look. Of course, you can change them to your liking.

##### We hope to expand it soon and to receive the participation of everyone who wants to support the project, new components are expected within 2 to 3 weeks.
